    fullDescription: `Borderland Decrypt is a technical puzzle-based event inspired by the world of Alice in Borderland,
Round 1 begins with cryptic written puzzles and logical riddles. Solving them reveals a hidden access
code that allows teams to move forward.
Round 2 places participants inside a digital maze of locked folders and encrypted files. Progress
depends on solving technical quizzes based on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning,
and Data Science. Each correct answer unlocks the next file, eventually revealing a fragmented image
that must be reconstructed.
Round 3 shifts the challenge into the physical Borderland. A mysterious map leads teams to hidden
puzzle pieces and a locked treasure box. Finding the key and assembling the final puzzle completes the
challenge.`,
